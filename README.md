# Local Contexs

This module allows you to apply [Local Contexts](https://localcontexts.org) labels and notices to Omeka sites and items.

Local Contexts is a global initiative that supports Indigenous communities with tools that can reassert cultural authority in heritage collections and data. 

## Requirements

This module requires setting up a [Local Contexts](https://localcontexts.org/) account and creating Projects in the registry. 

Then enter the API key into Omeka to import the chosen labels and notices and add them to items, site pages, and Omeka S site footers.
